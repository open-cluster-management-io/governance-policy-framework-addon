## Description

### Secret Sync Controller

The secret sync controller runs on managed clusters and syncs the `policy-encryption-key` `Secret` from the Hub to the
managed cluster. This controller requires access to get, create, update, and delete `Secret` objects in
the managed cluster namespace. Since the managed cluster namespace is not known at build time, the
configuration in `deploy/operator.yaml` grants this access cluster wide. In a production
environment, limit this to just the managed cluster namespace.

### Spec Sync Controller

The spec sync controller runs on managed clusters, updating local `Policy` specs to match `Policies` in the cluster's namespace on the hub cluster.

The controller watches for changes to Policies in the cluster's namespace on the hub cluster to trigger a reconcile. Every reconcile creates/updates/deletes replicated policies on the managed cluster to match the spec from the hub cluster.

### Status Sync Controller

The status sync controller runs on managed clusters, updating `Policy` statuses on both the hub and (local) managed clusters, based on events and changes in the managed cluster.

This controller watches for the following changes to trigger a reconcile:

1. policy changes in the watched cluster namespace on the managed cluster
2. events on policies in the watched cluster namespace on the managed cluster

Every reconcile does the following things:

1. Creates/updates the policy status on the hub and managed cluster in cluster namespace

### Template Sync Controller

The template sync controller runs on managed clusters and updates objects defined in the templates of `Policies` in the cluster namespace.

This controller watches for changes on `Policies` in the cluster namespace on the managed cluster to trigger a reconcile. On each reconcile, it creates/updates/deletes objects defined in the `spec.policy-templates` of those `Policies`.

## Getting started

Go to the
[Contributing guide](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/sig-policy/contribution-guidelines.md)
to learn how to get involved.

Check the [Security guide](SECURITY.md) if you need to report a security issue.

### Build and deploy locally
You will need [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) installed.

```bash
make kind-bootstrap-cluster-dev
make build-images
make kind-deploy-controller-dev
```
### Running tests
```
make test-dependencies
make test

make e2e-dependencies
make e2e-test
```

### Clean up
```
make kind-delete-cluster
```

### deploy/operator.yaml

The `deploy/operator.yaml` file is generated via Kustomize. The `deploy/rbac` directory of
Kustomize files is managed by the operator-sdk and Kubebuilder using
[markers](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers.html). After updating the markers or
any of the Kustomize files, you may regenerate `deploy/operator.yaml` by running
`make generate-operator-yaml`.
